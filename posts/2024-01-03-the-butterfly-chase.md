Today, I chased a butterfly through the garden. It was a dance of colors, fluttering just out of reach, leading me through bushes and over flower beds. Although I never caught it, the thrill of the chase filled my heart with joy. It reminded me to enjoy the journey, even if I don't always catch what I'm after.
